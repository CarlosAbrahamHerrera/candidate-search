# GitHub Candidate Search App üîç

## What is this?
This is my Module 13 challenge where I made an app that helps you search through GitHub users like you're on a hiring app! You can swipe (well, click buttons) through different GitHub profiles and save the ones you like.

## How it works
- Click through GitHub profiles
- Hit the + button if you like them
- Hit the - button if you want to skip
- Check your saved candidates in the "Saved Candidates" page
- Your saved candidates stay there even if you refresh!

## Cool features I added
- Sort your saved candidates by name, location, or company
- Filter through your saved candidates
- Nice blue gradient background
- Glassmorphism effect on the cards (learned that from YouTube!)

## How to use it
1. Clone this repo
2. Make a `.env` file and add your GitHub token like this:
   ```
   VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Check it out at http://localhost:5173

## What I used
- React (with TypeScript which was kinda hard at first)
- Vite (super fast!)
- GitHub API
- localStorage for saving candidates
- CSS for making it look nice

## What I learned
- How to use TypeScript with React
- Working with APIs and environment variables
- Using localStorage to save data
- React Router for navigation
- That CSS gradients are pretty cool
